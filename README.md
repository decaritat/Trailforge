# Trailforge

Trailforge is a locally installable open-source application for planning hikes and cycling tours. It is intended as a clear alternative to online outdoor platforms for tour planning and navigation: routes are created, edited, analyzed, and exported as GPX files on an OpenStreetMap-based map.

Trailforge is intended to run on Windows 11 and Linux. The desktop application is based on Tauri 2, React, TypeScript, and Leaflet. Map data is loaded online by default; offline and cache support is planned for a later stage.

## Current status

- OpenStreetMap Carto and OpenTopoMap
- Manually triggered place search for towns, landmarks, and other locations, with map highlighting
- Multiple independently editable hiking and cycling routes
- Routing through BRouter with separate hiking-beta and trekking profiles and a
  direct fallback when the provider fails; routing failures are shown per route
  with provider-specific messages, a retry action, and a dismissible error
  banner
- Visible map-layer errors with a consistent retry banner when tile providers
  are unavailable; the banner can be dismissed with its close button
- Route waypoints created by clicking, deleted through the context menu or Delete key, and inserted by dragging onto the route
- Route name, description, type, and color
- Elevation profile with distance, elevation, and time information
- Distance, ascent, descent, duration, highest-point, and lowest-point metrics
- Saving and opening project files
- GPX export and read-only GPX import by default
- Independent points and POIs on the map with categorized symbols
- Zoom-dependent map scale and north arrow
- Inspector tooltips explaining routing and elevation state, and direct
  context-sensitive provider attribution links (OpenStreetMap, OpenTopoMap,
  BRouter, Nominatim, Leaflet)
- About dialog (Info) with version, project links, data attributions, and a
  filterable list of third-party components with license texts
## Development

```text
npm install
npm run dev
npm run build
npm run lint
```

The Tauri desktop shell requires Rust and the platform-specific prerequisites for Tauri 2:

```text
npm run desktop:dev
npm run desktop:build
```

Architecture and development rules are documented in [.github/copilot-instructions.md](.github/copilot-instructions.md).

The About dialog lists third-party components from
`src/generated/third-party.json`, which `npm run dev` and `npm run build`
generate with `scripts/generate-third-party.mjs` (npm packages from
`package-lock.json` after `npm ci`, Rust crates through `cargo about`). Without
`cargo-about` the Rust crates are left out and the dialog says so; release
builds require them.

## Releases

Pushing a tag starting with `v` runs `.github/workflows/release.yml`. It
builds a Windows NSIS installer (`.exe`) and a Linux AppImage (on Ubuntu 22.04
for broad glibc compatibility). The tag is the single source of truth for the
version: the workflow writes it into `package.json` and `src-tauri/Cargo.toml`
and the bundle configuration during the build, so the versions committed in the
repository are placeholders and need no manual update. Development builds show
`-dev` after the version in the About dialog.
Nothing is published unless both builds succeed.

- Final tag, e.g. `v0.2.0`: creates a **draft** GitHub Release with both
  assets. The description is taken from the `## [0.2.0]` section of
  `Changelog.md`, which must exist and be non-empty (checked before building).
  Review the draft and publish it manually on GitHub.
- Pre-release, i.e. `vX.Y.Z-<anything>` such as `v0.2.0-rc.1` or
  `v0.2.0-nightly`: no GitHub Release is created. The
  installers are pushed to GitHub Packages as an OCI artifact
  (`ghcr.io/<owner>/trailforge/installers:v0.2.0-rc.1`; characters not allowed
  in OCI tags become `-`), downloadable with
  `oras pull`).

```text
git tag v0.2.0-rc.1 && git push origin v0.2.0-rc.1
git tag v0.2.0 && git push origin v0.2.0
```

### Licenses and SBOM

Trailforge is GPL-3.0-or-later. `.github/workflows/licenses.yml` (on every
dependency change and before every release build) generates
`THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md` (package, version, origin, license, copyright, full
license texts) for production npm dependencies and Rust crates, plus CycloneDX
SBOMs (`sbom-npm.cdx.json`, `sbom-rust.cdx.json`). The job fails if a lock file
is out of sync or a dependency has an unknown license or one not on the
allowlist (`.github/scripts/npm_notices.py`, `src-tauri/about.toml`). The
notices and `LICENSE` are bundled into the installers and attached to the
release/package. Binary distribution under GPLv3 requires offering the
corresponding source: the tagged GitHub repository serves as that source.

## Development with AI assistance

Trailforge is developed with the assistance of AI. AI is used for requirements analysis, architectural decisions, implementation, documentation, and quality assurance. Decisions, code reviews, and responsibility for the results remain with the project team.

## Data, attribution, and license

Map data and map tiles are currently loaded online and are not bundled with the application. OpenStreetMap attribution is displayed in the application. Before using additional providers, their terms of use, tile limits, API requirements, and attribution requirements must be checked.

### Place search

Place search uses the public Nominatim service. Searches are sent only after
the user submits the search field; there is no autocomplete. Results include
OpenStreetMap attribution. Search results with area geometry are outlined and
fitted to the map; point results receive a temporary pin. The Tauri desktop
application identifies its request with a `Trailforge` User-Agent.

The public Nominatim service has limited capacity. Its policy requires
identifying the application, visible attribution, no more than one request per
second across the application, and the ability to switch services if requested.
Trailforge caches results for the current app session and prevents searches
more frequent than once per second in that session. This client-side limit
cannot enforce the aggregate limit across all Trailforge installations; usage
must remain moderate, and a configurable provider or proxy is needed before
relying on the public service at larger scale. See the
[Nominatim Usage Policy](https://operations.osmfoundation.org/policies/nominatim/).

### Routing provider

Trailforge currently uses the public BRouter instance at
`https://brouter.de/brouter`. It does not require an API key and
selects the routing mode from the route type:

| Route type | BRouter profile | Routing behavior |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Hiking | `hiking-beta` | Hiking profile for foot routes and trails |
| Cycling | `trekking` | Elevation-aware cycling profile with a preference for routes away from car traffic |

The public endpoint currently returns a successful route for `hiking-beta`;
the `hiking` profile currently responds with an HTTP 500 error and is
therefore not used. BRouter was selected because its profiles are configurable,
elevation-aware, and available without an API key. The public service is subject to its
availability and fair-use policies; self-hosting BRouter remains an option for
predictable capacity and custom profiles. GraphHopper and OpenRouteService
provide strong hiking and cycling profiles, but their hosted APIs normally
require an API key. OSRM is fast and its public demo currently accepts `foot`
and `cycling`, but its profiles are statically prepared by the server.

The project is licensed under [GNU GPL-3.0-or-later](LICENSE). Derived projects and forks must comply with the applicable copyleft obligations.
